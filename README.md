🧹 Data Preprocessing
A repository for essential data preprocessing techniques used in machine learning and data analysis workflows. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, outlier detection, and more.

📖 About
This project contains reusable scripts and notebooks to clean and prepare raw datasets for modeling and analysis. Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the data science pipeline, and this repo aims to simplify and standardize that process.

✨ Features
Handle missing values (imputation, deletion)

Encode categorical variables (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding)

Normalize or scale numerical features (MinMax, Standard Scaler)

Remove outliers

Data type conversion

Train-test splitting

Data visualization (for preprocessing insights)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visual analysis)
